# KDGA-Insights
The KDGA-Insight23 dataset is a meticulously curated collection of network traffic data designed to facilitate research in the field of cybersecurity. 
Comprising over 2 million records, the dataset combines attributes extracted from DNS over HTTPS (DoH) traffic, including packet size, duration, quantities of incoming and outgoing flows, time intervals between DNS queries, and geographical data associated with IP addresses. 
The dataset is organized into three distinct levels of classification, each targeting a specific aspect of threat detection. 
It enables researchers to explore and analyze the effectiveness of a three-level architecture in identifying Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) domains encapsulated within DoH tunnels. 
The KDGA-Insight23 dataset stands as a valuable resource for advancing knowledge in cybersecurity and enhancing the understanding of modern network threats.
